## Binaries, Houdini 16
* [Windows, Houdini 16.0.557](https://github.com/ttvd/houdini-geo-vox/releases/download/1.0.3/houdini.geo.vox.16.0.557.win.rar)

## Binaries, Houdini 15
* [Mac OS X, Houdini 15.0.434](https://github.com/ttvd/houdini-geo-vox/releases/download/1.0.2/houdini.geo.vox.15.0.434.osx.tar.gz)
* [Windows, Houdini 15.0.440](https://github.com/ttvd/houdini-geo-vox/releases/download/1.0.2/houdini.geo.vox.15.0.440.win.rar)

## Building

* Tested on OS X 10.11 / Windows and Houdini 15.
  * You would have to patch CMake file to get this building on Linux.
* Define HOUDINI_VERSION env variable to be the version of Houdini 15 you wish to build against (for example "15.0.313").
* Alternatively, you can have HFS env variable defined (set when you source houdini_setup).
* Generate build files from CMake for your favorite build system. For Windows builds use MSVC 2012.
* Build the GEO Houdini dso (GEO_Vox.dylib or GEO_Vox.dll).
* Place the dso in the appropriate Houdini dso folder.
  * On OS X this would be /Users/your_username/Library/Preferences/houdini/15.0/dso/
  * On Windows this would be C:\Users\your_username\Documents\houdini15.0\dso

## Usage

* Place a file SOP, select a .vox file.
* This will create a Houdini volume, containing LUT color values data.
* Use [LUT loading SOP](https://github.com/ttvd/houdini-sop-color-lut) to further process the data.
* Also have a look at [Volume center points SOP](https://github.com/ttvd/houdini-sop-volume-center-points) .
* Please see the [example HIP file.](example/)
